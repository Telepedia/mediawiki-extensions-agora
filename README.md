**Agora** [(pun intended)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agora) is a MediaWiki extension providing a modern comment system for users. Agora is built using Vue with MediaWiki's VisualEditor to provide WYSIWYG editing - it fully supports wikitext.

Agora was born out of the dislike of the current comments extensions for MediaWiki - for which there are many. Comments are displayed below articles and can be toggled on or off for each article indpendently.
